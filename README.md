# COM316 - Artificial Intelligence

This repository has all my work for the **Artificial Intelligence** class at Connecticut College taught by [Gary Parker](https://oak.conncoll.edu/parker/).  The class covers the history of Artificial Intelligence, from basic search systems to rule-based systems.  The programming assignments are in [Petite Chez Scheme](https://www.scheme.com/csv8.4/) .

Every week, a new topic was introduced with a problem statement, and the students were expected to find a solution to this problem without using outside sources. The problem prompts, and my (and my groupmates') answers can be found in the [Problems](problems) folder.

The class after the problem is assigned, the student solutions are due, and the correct solutions are discussed. At the end of the class, a solution is agreed upon, and it should be implemented in Scheme due next class. My groupmates' and my implementations are in the [Programming Assignments](programming_assignments) folder. 

At the same time as the programming assignment, a reading assignment with standard questions is also due. Reading assignments can be found in the [Books and Readings](books_and_readings) folder, while our answers to standard questions can be found in the [Standard Questions](standard_questions) folder. 

Lastly, students are expected to write a weekly reflection on each topic covered in class and the reading assignments, which are due at the end of the semester. My AI Notebook and the assignment prompt can be found in the [AI Notebook](ai_notebook) folder.
